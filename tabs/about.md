I am a young student from the UK interested in ethical hacking. I have taken part in [Cyber Discovery](https://joincyberdiscovery.com/) for the past year, and attended Elite Online in Summer 2020. I started [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) in the same Summer and enjoy it alot. I prefer it to Cyber Discovery because the challenges are more realistic and the goal of the challenge is more clear.

On this page I will post Hack the Box writeups when machines retire. In the future I may post other content.
