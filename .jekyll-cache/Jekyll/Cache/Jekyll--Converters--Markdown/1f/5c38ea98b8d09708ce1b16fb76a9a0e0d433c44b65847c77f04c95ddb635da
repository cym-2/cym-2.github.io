I"»<p><strong>(10) the network layer</strong><br />
In the seven-layer OSI model of computer network, the network layer is layer 3. The network layer is responsible for packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers. 
<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>(11) the OSI model</strong><br />
The Open System Interconnection (OSI). It has been developed by ISO - ‚ÄòInternational Organization of Standardization‚Äô. It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All tese 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data fr4om one person to another across the globe.</p>

<p><strong>(12) a DHCP server and the DHCP protocol</strong><br />
 DHCP server: DHCP (Dynamic Host Confivguration Protocol), is a protocol that provides quick, automatic, and central management for the distribution of IP addresses within a network. DHCP is also used to configure  the subnet mask, default gateway and DNS server information on the device.
<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>(13) a DNS server and the DNS protocol</strong><br />
Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of internet. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load internet resources.</p>

<p>The <strong>Domain Network System (DNS) protocol</strong> helps internet users and network devises discover websites using human-readable hostnames, instead of  numeric IP addresses.
<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>(14) the rules to make 2 devices communicate using IP addresses</strong><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Your computer connects to the router using TCP/IP and asks for a local IP address.</li>
  <li>The router responds and gives your computer the local IP address 192.168.1.12</li>
  <li>Your router requests an IP address to connect to the Internect. The ISP assigns your WAN address as 175.51.127.17</li>
  <li>While on the Internet you request access to the Computer Hope server by entering the URL http://www.computerhope.com. Using DNS that address is translated to an IP address 69.72.169.241 and TCP/IP packet travels over multiple routers and computers until it reaches that address.</li>
  <li>Your TCP/IP packet reaches its destination and communicates with the other computer it responds and repeats the above steps to get the data back to your computer.
<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(15) IPÎ°ú routingÏù¥ Ïù¥Î£®Ïñ¥ÏßÄÎäî Î≤ï</strong><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Routing is the process by which data packets move from one node (machine or device) to another on a computer network until the packets reach the final destination.</li>
</ul>

<p>The header information includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The IP addresses of the source and destination nodes.</li>
  <li>Packet numbers that help reassemble the packets in the correct order whe  the packets reach the destination.</li>
  <li>Other useful technical information.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>(16) a default gateway for routing</strong><br />
 It allows devices within one network to send information to devises within another network. If you are requestiong a certain web page, the trafic is first sent to your default gateay before leaving the local network to reach its indended destination.</p>

In computer networking, a port is a communication endpoint. At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service. 
 Ports are identified for each protocol and address combination by 16-bit unsigned numbers, commonly known as the port number. The most common protocols that use port numbers are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).</p>
